The last couple of weeks have been pretty busy. In my spare time, at the end of the day when Iâ€™m not catching up on unfinished work, I've been tuning out. Turning off my brain. Consuming. This is the easy way.

The moments I've found some small amount energy or motivation to be more engaged, I've spent reviewing, reconsidering and adjusting my workflows. Researching URL schemes and x-callbacks, chaining apps and actions together into a symphony of interwoven software silos. Tweaking. Testing. Tweaking. Testing.

The results on paper look pretty impressive. At first glance, it appears I may be able to publish an essay to my blog simply by pressing my thumb and forefinger together and briefly thinking about the colour blue. Definitely worth the time and energy spent.

In reality, all of this "work" has saved me two, maybe three taps (take THAT, callouses!) from my previous set up. And in the time I spent "working", I neglected to create a single thing to warrant the use of my shiny new PUBLISH button. It didn't feel like it at the time, but this, too, is the easy way.

You know what isn't easy? Creating. Shipping. Looking deep enough within to find something worthwhile to share with the world. Having the courage to put my Work in front of others. For me this is the struggle, and too often I find myself taking the easy way.
